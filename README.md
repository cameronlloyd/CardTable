Would like:
    1. Better package and folder structure
    2. Testing:
        * Better testing framework instead of script
        * Testing around the __str__ methods. Not testing the stuff printed to the user prompt
        * Better patching/mocking to decouple some tests
        * more testing (like around card_table)
    3. Validation:
        * Around method parameters, in addition to the type hinting
    4. Better UI
